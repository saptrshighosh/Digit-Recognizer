# Digit Recognizer

## Overview

This project is developed by me - Saptrshi Ghosh with the objective of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits. It utilizes machine learning techniques and is aimed at demonstrating a practical application within the field of computer vision.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits. This challenge addresses the complexity of varying handwriting styles and the need for high precision in digit recognition.

## Input Dataset and Its Attributes

The model leverages the MNIST dataset, a renowned large database of handwritten digits commonly used in machine learning for training and testing purposes. Key characteristics of the MNIST dataset include:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images
- 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits (0-9)
- Images are labeled with the corresponding digit they represent

## Problem-Solving Methodology

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to tackle this classification problem, thanks to its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The CNN architecture consists of:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- A flattening layer and a dense layer for classification

Preprocessing steps involve normalizing the pixel values of images, reshaping the images for the CNN, and one-hot encoding the labels.

## Results Achieved

- The results, including accuracy and loss, vary based on the execution of the code.
- A well-tuned CNN model on the MNIST dataset is expected to achieve high accuracy, often above 95% on the test set.

## Performance Metrics

For evaluating the model's performance, the following metrics are employed:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified images in the test set.
- **Loss**: Specifically, categorical crossentropy, providing insights into the model's predictive performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of a Convolutional Neural Network in accurately classifying handwritten digits, showcasing the potential of deep learning in computer vision tasks.
